# ROUTER 1x3 DESIGN
A router is a kind of protocol to route packets from one source network to one of the 3 destination networks. The destination network can have the addresses 0, 1 and 2. The address 3 is invalid.
The design is implemented using Hardware Description Language (HDL) called Verilog.
To know more about how the design works, please go through the blocks_and_specifications.txt to know how exactly router works.


# TOOLS USED
1. Used ModelSim and Questasim to simulate the RTL design with the testbench and verified whether the design was working as per the functionality. 
2. Used QuartusPrime to generate the synthesized circuit in terms of gates for all the sub-blocks including the top level module of the router.
