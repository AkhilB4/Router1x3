# ROUTER 1x3 DESIGN
A router is a kind of protocol to route packets from one source to one of the 3 destination networks. The destination network can have the addresses 0, 1 and 2. The address 3 is invalid.
The design is implemented using Hardware Description Language (HDL) called Verilog.
To know more about how the design works, please go through the blocks_and_specifications.txt to know how exactly router works.
